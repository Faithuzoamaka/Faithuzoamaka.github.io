    <p class="fu">A journey of thousand miles start with just a step. to be a web developer is not an easier task but with a strong determination, i am assuring you that everything is possible. If you try it for the first time and you fail, just know that you have to rise and then learn from your mistake and start it again. It is not must that you will get it right at initial time. what matters is what you had on your mind when your started. 
        <p class="fu">
        just like i have said that to be programmer is not easy but programmerds are the people earning will in this our present world. No job and our leaders are bot even showing any positive response as regard to that, therefore, we have to create job for ourselves and not to be waiting for white colar job. </p>
        <p class="fu">
        I have always wanted to be a programmer, a programmer I will always be. This is my decision for now and I know that so shall it be.
